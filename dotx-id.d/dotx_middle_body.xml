<section anchor="xdr_desc" title="XDR Description of NFSv4.0 " >
<t>

 This document contains the XDR (<xref target="RFC4506" />)
 description of NFSv4.0 protocol (<xref
 target="I-D.ietf-nfsv4-rfc3530bis" />).
</t>
<t>
 The XDR description is provided in this document in a way
 that makes it simple for the reader to extract into ready
 to compile form. The reader can feed this document in the
 following shell script to produce the machine readable XDR
 description of NFSv4.0:
</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
#!/bin/sh
grep "^  *///" | sed 's?^  */// ??' | sed 's?^  *///$??'

</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
I.e. if the above script is stored in a file called "extract.sh", and this document
is in a file called "spec.txt", then the reader can do:
</t>
<figure>
<artwork>
 sh extract.sh < spec.txt > nfs4_prot.x
</artwork>
</figure>

<t>
 The effect of the script is to remove leading white space
 from each line, plus a sentinel sequence of "///". 
</t>
<t>
 The XDR description, with the sentinel sequence follows:
