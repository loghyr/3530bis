<section anchor="sec:rpc_flavors" title="RPC and Security Flavor">
   
  <t>
    The NFSv4 protocol is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
    application that uses RPC version 2 and the corresponding eXternal
    Data Representation (XDR) as defined in <xref target="RFC5531" />
    and <xref target="RFC4506" />.  The RPCSEC_GSS security flavor as
    defined in <xref target="RFC2203" /> MUST be implemented
    as the mechanism to deliver stronger security for the NFSv4
    protocol.  However, deployment of RPCSEC_GSS is optional.
  </t>

  <section title="Ports and Transports">

    <t>
      Historically, NFSv2 and NFSv3 servers have resided on
      port 2049.  The registered port 2049 <xref target="RFC3232" /> for the NFS protocol
      SHOULD be the default configuration.  Using the registered port
      for NFS services means the NFS client will not need to use the RPC
      binding protocols as described in <xref target="RFC1833" />; this
      will allow NFS to transit firewalls.
    </t>

    <t>
      Where an NFSv4 implementation supports operation over the IP
      network protocol, the supported transports between NFS and IP MUST be
      among the IETF-approved congestion control transport protocols,
      which include TCP and SCTP.  To enhance the possibilities for
      interoperability, an NFSv4 implementation MUST support
      operation over the TCP transport protocol, at least until such time
      as a standards track RFC revises this requirement to use a different
      IETF-approved congestion control transport protocol.
    </t>

    <t>
      If TCP is used as the transport, the client and server SHOULD use
      persistent connections.  This will prevent the weakening of TCP's
      congestion control via short lived connections and will improve
      performance for the WAN environment by eliminating the need for
      SYN handshakes.
    </t>

    <t>
      As noted in <xref target="sec:security" />,
      the authentication model for NFSv4 has moved from
      machine-based to principal-based.  However, this modification
      of the authentication model does not
      imply a technical requirement to move the TCP connection management
      model from whole machine-based to one based on a per user model.
      In particular, NFS over TCP client implementations have traditionally
      multiplexed traffic for multiple users over a common TCP connection
      between an NFS client and server.  This has been true, regardless
      whether the NFS client is using AUTH_SYS, AUTH_DH, RPCSEC_GSS or
      any other flavor.  Similarly, NFS over TCP server implementations
      have assumed such a model and thus scale the implementation of TCP
      connection management in proportion to the number of expected client
      machines.  It is intended that NFSv4 will not modify this
      connection management model.  NFSv4 clients that violate
      this assumption can expect scaling issues on the server and hence
      reduced service.
    </t>

    <t>
      Note that for various timers, the client and server should avoid
      inadvertent synchronization of those timers.  For further discussion
      of the general issue refer to <xref target="Floyd" />.
    </t>

    <section title="Client Retransmission Behavior">

      <t>
        When processing a request received over a reliable transport such as
        TCP, the NFSv4 server MUST NOT silently drop the request,
        except if the transport connection has been broken.  Given such a
        contract between NFSv4 clients and servers, clients MUST NOT
        retry a request unless one or both of the following are true:

        <list style='symbols'>
          <t>
            The transport connection has been broken
          </t>

          <t>
            The procedure being retried is the NULL procedure
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Since reliable transports, such as TCP, do not always synchronously
        inform a peer when the other peer has broken the connection (for
        example, when an NFS server reboots), the NFSv4 client may
        want to actively "probe" the connection to see if has been broken.
        Use of the NULL procedure is one recommended way to do so.  So, when
        a client experiences a remote procedure call timeout (of some
        arbitrary implementation specific amount), rather than retrying the
        remote procedure call, it could instead issue a NULL procedure call
        to the server.  If the server has died, the transport connection
        break will eventually be indicated to the NFSv4 client.
        The client can then reconnect, and then retry the original request.
        If the NULL procedure call gets a response, the connection has
        not broken.  The client can decide to wait longer for the original
        request's response, or it can break the transport connection and
        reconnect before re-sending the original request.
      </t>

      <t>
        For callbacks from the server to the client, the same rules apply,
        but the server doing the callback becomes the client, and the client
        receiving the callback becomes the server.
      </t>

  <section title="Security Flavors">

    <t>
      Traditional RPC implementations have included AUTH_NONE, AUTH_SYS,
      AUTH_DH, and AUTH_KRB4 as security flavors.  With
      <xref target="RFC2203" /> an additional security flavor of RPCSEC_GSS
      has been introduced which uses the functionality of GSS-API
      <xref target="RFC2743" />.  This allows for the
      use of various security mechanisms by the RPC layer without the
      additional implementation overhead of adding RPC security flavors.
      For NFSv4, the RPCSEC_GSS security flavor MUST be used to
      enable the mandatory security mechanism.  Other flavors, such as,
      AUTH_NONE, AUTH_SYS, and AUTH_DH MAY be implemented as well.
    </t>

    <section title="Security mechanisms for NFSv4">

      <t>
        The use of RPCSEC_GSS requires selection of: mechanism, quality
        of protection, and service (authentication, integrity, privacy).
        The remainder of this document will refer to these three parameters
        of the RPCSEC_GSS security as the security triple.
      </t>

      <section anchor="krb5:sectrip" title="Kerberos V5 as a security triple">

        <t>
          The Kerberos V5 GSS-API mechanism as described in <xref target="RFC1964" /> MUST be
          implemented and provide the following security triples.
        </t>

        </t>

        <t>
          Note that the pseudo flavor is presented here as a mapping aid to the
          implementor.  Because this NFS protocol includes a method to negotiate
          security and it understands the GSS-API mechanism, the pseudo flavor
          is not needed.  The pseudo flavor is needed for NFSv3 since
          the security negotiation is done via the MOUNT protocol.
        </t>

        <t>
          For a discussion of NFS' use of RPCSEC_GSS and Kerberos V5, please see
          <xref target="RFC2623" />.
        </t>

        <t>
          Users and implementors are warned that 56 bit DES is no longer
          considered state of the art in terms of resistance to brute force
          attacks.  Once a revision to <xref target="RFC1964" /> is available that adds support
          for AES, implementors are urged to incorporate AES into their NFSv4
          over Kerberos V5 protocol stacks, and users are similarly urged to
          migrate to the use of AES.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section title="Security Negotiation">

  <t>
    With the NFSv4 server potentially offering multiple security
    mechanisms, the client needs a method to determine or negotiate
    which mechanism is to be used for its communication with the server.
    The NFS server may have multiple points within its filesystem name
    space that are available for use by NFS clients.  In turn the NFS
    server may be configured such that each of these entry points may
    have different or multiple security mechanisms in use.
  </t>

  <t>
    The security negotiation between client and server SHOULD be done
    with a secure channel to eliminate the possibility of a third party
    intercepting the negotiation sequence and forcing the client and
    server to choose a lower level of security than required or desired.
    See <xref target="sec:security" /> for further discussion.
  </t>

    <section title="SECINFO">

      <t>
        The new SECINFO operation will allow the client to determine, on a per
        filehandle basis, what security triple is to be used for server access.
        In general, the client will not have to use the SECINFO operation
        except during initial communication with the server or when the client
        crosses policy boundaries at the server.  It is possible that the
        server's policies change during the client's interaction therefore
        forcing the client to negotiate a new security triple.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Error">

      <t>
        Based on the assumption that each NFSv4 client and server
        MUST support a minimum set of security (i.e.,
        Kerberos-V5 under RPCSEC_GSS), the NFS client will start its
        communication with the server with one of the minimal security triples.
        During communication with the server, the client may receive an NFS
        error of NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC.  This error allows the server to notify the
        client that the security triple currently being used is not appropriate
        for access to the server's filesystem resources.  The client is then
        responsible for determining what security triples are available at the
        server and choose one which is appropriate for the client.  See 
        <xref target="OP_SECINFO" /> for further discussion of how
        the client will respond to the NFS4ERR_WRONGSEC error and use SECINFO.
      </t>
    </section>

  <section title="Callback RPC Authentication">

      <t>
        Except as noted elsewhere in this section, the callback RPC (described
        later) MUST mutually authenticate the NFS server to the principal
        that acquired the client ID (also described later), using the security
        flavor the original SETCLIENTID operation used.
      </t>

      <t>
        For AUTH_NONE, there are no principals, so this is a non-issue.
      </t>

      <t>
        AUTH_SYS has no notions of mutual authentication or a server principal,
        so the callback from the server simply uses the AUTH_SYS credential
        that the user used when he set up the delegation.
      </t>
 
      <t>
        For AUTH_DH, one commonly used convention is that the server uses
        the credential corresponding to this AUTH_DH principal:

        <figure>
          <artwork>
  unix.host@domain
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        where host and domain are variables corresponding to the name of
        server host and directory services domain in which it lives such as
        a Network Information System domain or a DNS domain.
      </t>

      <t>
        Regardless of what security mechanism under RPCSEC_GSS is
        being used, the NFS server, MUST identify itself in GSS-API via a
        GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE name type.  GSS_C_NT_HOSTBASED_SERVICE names
        are of the form:

        <figure>
          <artwork>
  service@hostname
          </artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>

      <t>
        For NFS, the "service" element is

        <figure>
          <artwork>
  nfs
          </artwork>
        </figure>

        Implementations of security mechanisms will convert nfs@hostname to
        various different forms.  For Kerberos V5, the following
        form is RECOMMENDED:

        <figure>
          <artwork>
nfs/hostname
          </artwork>
        </figure>
      </t>

      <t>
        For Kerberos V5, nfs/hostname would be a server principal in
        the Kerberos Key Distribution Center database.  This is the same
        principal the client acquired a GSS-API context for when it issued
        the SETCLIENTID operation, therefore, the realm name for the
        server principal must be the same for the callback as it was for
        the SETCLIENTID.
