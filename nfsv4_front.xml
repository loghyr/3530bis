      <t>
        The Network File System (NFS) version 4 is a distributed file system
        protocol which builds on the heritage of NFS protocol version 2, RFC 1094, and
        version 3, RFC 1813.  Unlike earlier versions, the NFS version 4
        protocol supports traditional file access while integrating support
        for file locking and the mount protocol.  In addition, support for
        strong security (and its negotiation), compound operations, client
        caching, and internationalization have been added.  Of course,
        attention has been applied to making NFS version 4 operate well in an
        Internet environment.

        This document, together with the companion XDR description 
        document, RFCNFSv4XDR, obsoletes RFC 3530 as the definition of the 
        NFS version 4 protocol.
