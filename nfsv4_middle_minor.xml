<section anchor="sec:minor" title="Minor Versioning">
  <t>
   To address the requirement of an NFS protocol that can evolve as the
   need arises, the NFSv4 protocol contains the rules and
   framework to allow for future minor changes or versioning.
  </t>

  <t>
   The base assumption with respect to minor versioning is that any
   future accepted minor version must follow the IETF process and be
   documented in a standards track RFC.  Therefore, each minor version
   number will correspond to an RFC.  Minor version 0 of the NFS
   version 4 protocol is represented by this RFC.  The COMPOUND
   and CB_COMPOUND procedures support the encoding of the minor version being
   requested by the client.
  </t>

  <t>
    Future minor versions will extend, rather than replace the XDR
    for the preceding minor version, as had been done in moving
    from NFSv2 to NFSv3 and from NFSv3 to NFSv4.0.
  </t>

  <t>
    Specification of detailed rules for the construction of minor
    versions will be addressed in documents defining early minor
    versions or, more desirably, in an RFC establishing a versioning
    framework for NFSv4 as a whole.
